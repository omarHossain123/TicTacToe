The Tic-Tac-Toe app is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using React. It provides players with an interactive experience where they can enjoy the timeless game either in single-player mode against an AI opponent or in multiplayer mode against a friend.

Key features include:
Single-player mode: Players can choose from different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) to challenge     themselves against an AI opponent.

Multiplayer mode: Players can play against a friend on the same device, taking turns to make moves.

Dynamic theme switching: The app supports both light and dark themes, allowing users to customize their visual experience.

Modal overlay: A modal overlay appears at the end of each game to announce the winner or declare a draw, providing options to restart the game or return to the main menu.
